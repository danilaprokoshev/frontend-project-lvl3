## About

[**RSS Reader**](https://frontend-project-lvl3-nine-tau.vercel.app) is my educational project that I performed during the studying on [hexlet.io](https://ru.hexlet.io/professions) (project level 3).

RSS Reader is a service for aggregating RSS-feeds which makes reading various sources conceivable and enjoyable (e.g., blogs). It submits to add an unlimited amount of RSS-channels, updates them, and pushes posts into the common thread.
